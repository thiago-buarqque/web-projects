# Julia clothing

This project was made to improve my Typescript and Redux acknowledges.

You can see the project [here](https://ecommerce-using-react-js-redux-and-typescript-thiago-buarqque.vercel.app/).

### At the store you can:

- Add, remove and edit cart's items
- Buy a product
- Choose your clothing color and size before buying it
- Search for your address on checkout using your Brazilian postcode (CEP)

### Technologies and libraries

- Typescript
- ReactJS
- React Router Dom
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/)

-> All products data fetch are fake, I didn't find a API to help me making this project more real. But it has the product Typescript type and so on.

Disclaimer: All products on this website are from riachuelo.com.br. This is not a real website and I don't want to get any revenue from it. If you're the owner of the product images, please contact me https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiago-buarque/
